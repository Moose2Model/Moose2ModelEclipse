# Moose2ModelEclipse
Eclipse Frontend of Moose2Model (Currently evaluation only)

This repository is created to evaluate and potentially prototype an Eclipse frontend for Moose2Model.

It will probably connected in a first step to SAP ABAP only with coding that is part of the SAP2Moose project.

General requirements:

1. It shall be possible to add further languages in the future, not only SAP2Moose

Possible features of first step.

1. Import an xml file that contains a Moose2Model layout
2. Determine all connected elements by calling coding that is part of SAP2Moose
3. Displaying the layout together with the stored comments
4. Allow to jump from the elements of the layout to the coding in Eclipse

Possible features of second step.

1. Generate a new layout by starting with a certain element in Eclipse
2. Allow to edit this layout and add new features
3. Allow to store this layout to file

Points to be evaluated:

1. Are there already existing enhancement projects for Eclipse that have the required features?
2. Are there sufficient development capacities available to support an Eclipse frontend also?
3. Are there sufficient benefits to provide an Eclipse frontend?
